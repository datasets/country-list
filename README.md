Nevertheless, it should be noted that this material is ultimately sourced from
ISO and their rights and licensing policy is somewhat unclear. As this is a
short, simple database of facts there is a strong argument that no rights can
subsist in this collection. However, ISO state on [their
site](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes.htm): 

> ISO makes the list of alpha-2 country codes available for internal use and
> non-commercial purposes free of charge. 

This carries the implication (though not spelled out) that other uses are not
permitted and that, therefore, there may be rights preventing further general
use and reuse.
